                            Economics is a field where theories are easy to create, and very difficult to test. It’s impractical, if not impossible, to run a controlled experiment on a scale large enough to measure the true effect of policy on economies. Looking at historical data has problems as well, as economic statistics are often too coarse or unreliable to model or investigate macroeconomic theories. But a new paper from Computation Institute researchers presents an extraterrestrial solution -- using satellite images of Earth to measure economic activity on a global scale, and even provide early warnings about economic and humanitarian crises.more>>
